# No Place Like Home!		
A demographic survey of the USA based on the 2014 Census.  built with love by Saran, Murat, Sal, and Jon


Why Did We Build This?					
We wanted to create a website that searches for population, births, and deaths based on the US census. All the information we are pulling from the API is sourced from the 2014 census. The interest behind building the App came from the rising levels of inequality in the US and how quality of life affects lifespan, average income, and other factors. Although the amount of data we are currently gathering is not enough to project all of these things, it was our hope when starting to build that we would be able to get a better statistical picture of the USA and create graphs that would help people visualize how these variables influence our lives. 

Tech Used
Bootstrap
Jquery
Javascript
API’s
Census API
USA News API

AM Charts
AM Charts is a company that builds javascript graphs and charts that integrate easily into existing web applications. Using AM Charts for our map of the US made our project possible, and emphasized the importance of being able to integrate other technologies into a project if needed. 


What Was A Roadblock?		
Our project started off as an an attempt to find affordable housing based on different neighborhoods in the USA. As we progressed in our API search, we found that some of the data we needed was not readily available in the Census API so we modified our project to account for population, amount of births, and amount of deaths based on a state. Another challenge was finding a map that we could integrate into our project. We spent around 3 class days searching and trying to find a suitable map that we could integrate into our project. Once we found the map, provided by AM charts, we had to integrate our own search functionality into it.

Future Ideas
If we were to build upon our current App, it would be useful to add a function that searches our API’s by state Capital
Code an algorithm that assigns each state a “Hipster Rating” that correlates to the likelihood of a young urban hipster moving to that area.
Add the FBI API in order to include crime rate data in our state searches
